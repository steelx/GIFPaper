## Legal stuff

**First and foremost** GIFPaper is alpha quality software. It comes with **no
warranty** and **I (the author) take no responsibility** for any
problems/damage/anything else that may happen while using it. I've done my best
to keep the app safe and I don't think there's even a smallest chance of it
damaging your computer in any way but still, be advised of the above statement.

**As for the license** - all rights reserved for now. I'll probably open it on
GitHub when I get a chance to clean up the code.
